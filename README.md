# Recipe_app

## Getting Started

This is a simple recipe app.

It is a practice app for a [flutter course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) built with flutter and dart. Things you can do with it includes:

- Seeing different delicacies in different categories.
- Selecting your favorite recipes.
- Filtering the types of recipes you only want to see e.g only gluten free recipes.

You can start learning flutter and dart.
For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
